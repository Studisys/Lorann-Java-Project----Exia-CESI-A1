## About this project
This is a First Year Project at Exia CESI. It was fully designed in English.
This project consisted in recreating an abandonware (in this case : a game) entitled “Lorann”.

## Synopsis

*Lorann, Master of the Spell, the World of Nova-Ann needs your strength and your craftiness! <br/>
Free the hundred and one crypts detained by the Mask of Nekron, by reaching the Energy Bubble located in each. <br/>
Bring back the ephemeral Idols of the Life to the Cave, each will be worth two additional Lives. </br> </br>
Collect fabulous treasures which are waiting for you and your wealth will be tremendous! <br/>
Avoid the attacks of the four deadful Devils created by the vile Nekron, by cleverly using your very powerful and colorful Spell which obeys your will. </br>
Glory is waiting of for you, Lorann… May the Spell protect you!*
